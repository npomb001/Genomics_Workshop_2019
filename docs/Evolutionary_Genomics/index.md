# Evolutionary Genomics 

This section covers analyses for exploring and comparing genomes, genes, and species relationships.

Understanding of [Comparative Genomics](Comparative Genomics.md) to inventory gene content and differences between genomes of species or strains.

To examine species relationships and understand differences in gene content, phylogenetic analysis of genomes and gene sets are necessary. The section [Phylogenomics](Phylogenomics.md) provides an introduction to these concepts.
