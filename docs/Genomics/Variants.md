# Variant identification

To call SNPs and INDELs or identify variation in copy number of genes or genomic region is an important component of population genetics and genomics.

Definitions
* SNP - Single Nucleotide Polymorphism - identified as differences between a reference genome and an individual usually from genomic sequencing. Though RNASeq and other methods can
* INDEL - **Ins**ertion / **Del**etion
* CNV - Copy Number Variation. Could

# SNP and short INDEL



# Copy Number Variation

Plotting coverage is one simple way to look for copy number variation.
