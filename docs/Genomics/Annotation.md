# Genome Annotation

The description of genome annotation will be focused around a particular tool we wrote and which is geared towards fungal genome annotation. [Funannotate](http://funannotate.readthedocs.io) is series of integrated pipelines and analysis steps which can train gene predictors, integrate RNAseq data, and predict and combine best evidence for accurate gene prediction and deposition to GenBank.
